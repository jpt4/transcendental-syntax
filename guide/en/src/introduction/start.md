# Getting started

To install the Stellogen interpreter, go to this Git repository:

[https://github.com/engboris/stellogen](https://github.com/engboris/stellogen)

You can either compile from [sources](https://github.com/engboris/stellogen/blob/master/README.md#build-from-sources) or download a pre-compiled executable:

- For Linux x86-x64: [https://github.com/engboris/stellogen/releases](https://github.com/engboris/stellogen/releases)

You can then simply write your programs in any text file and follow the instructions in the [README.md](https://github.com/engboris/stellogen/blob/master/README.md#commands) file of the git repository to execute your programs.

For a quick preview, don't hesitate to look up:
