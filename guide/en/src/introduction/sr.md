# Stellar resolution

Stellar resolution is the (theoretical) language of transcendental syntax. It
is a language functioning through asynchronous interaction of independent
agents. This interaction is based on a unification algorithm (that involved in
the Prolog language) working as a minimal computation core.

It represents computation by a network of syntactical constraints that must be
resolved to propagate information. The result of the computation corresponds to
the information left by the networks that remained coherent until the end
without encountering conflicts.

These ideas already exist in logical programming but are reformulated and used
differently. In particular, we assign no logical sense to objects (even if they
can be seen this way, they are not supposed to represent relations or objects
of logical systems).

This calculus can be understood in several ways. It is:

 - a process calculus;
 - a constraint-based programming language;
 - a variant of disjunctive clauses with Robinson's resolution rule;
 - a non-planar generalization of Wang tiles or abstract tile assembly models
 (aTAM);
 - a generalization of Jonoska's flexible tiles used in DNA computing;
 - a generalization of LEGO bricks;
 - a low-level language expressing logical sense;
 - a toolbox for constructing types/formulas;
 - a generalization of Jean-Yves Girard's proof structures;
 - a form of Lafont's interaction nets using no other rules than term
 unification principles.
