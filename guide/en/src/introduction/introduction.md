# Introduction

Welcome to the guide to transcendental syntax.

This guide presents the ideas of Jean-Yves Girard from the perspective of a
computer scientist.

**Please note that this guide is highly experimental and subject to frequent
changes. The language it describes is equally unstable.**

I welcome any opinions, recommendations, suggestions, or simple
questions. Feel free to contact me at

Happy reading!
