# Stellogen language

The *Stellogen* language is a programming language used to define, manipulate,
and put in interaction stellar resolution entities, and thus illustrate the
principles of transcendental syntax.

It is one possible computer realization of stellar resolution and
transcendental syntax, that makes design choices to adapt to programming
practices.

It has an interpreter written in OCaml, as well as an execution engine for
stellar resolution (which is an independent language) called "Large Star
Collider" (LSC), also written in OCaml.

If stellar resolution is a language of elementary bricks (like LEGO),
then:

 - transcendental syntax is the theory of bricks;
 - the Large Star Collider is the principle allowing brick connectivity;
 - Stellogen is a language allowing manipulation of these bricks to make
 advanced construction that would be too tedious to do by hand.

Stellogen is the language we are going to explore step by step in this small
guide.
